glfw
1. download glfw and create a c++ project
2. create a new cpp file and set up main function
3. go to glfw documentation and copy the code to create window to cpp file
4. in the download, the include folder and lib matters for our project. open a new folder in our project called dependancies
(parallel to sln file) make a folder called GLFW in dependancies folder
5. for this project, copy the 3.lib file (static linking) copy include and lib folder to dependancies
6. set up the linker in visual studio
  - right click the project and click properties
  - choose all configurations and winows 64/32 appropriately
  - under c/c++ General, add include directories: type $(SolutionDir)dependancies\GLFW\include to make it reative to our sln file
  ($(SolutionDir)) is the solution dir automatically set up by visual studio (in macro)
  to make sure it's correct: click edit and copy the path to file explorer. the #include <GLFW/glfw3.h> should work after this step
  - under linker in general, specify additional library directories. type $(SolutionDir)dependancies\GLFW\lib-vc2022
  - under linker input, we will specify which file we are going to link. remove all the stuff there and type in glfw3.lib; opengl64.lib
glew
1. download glew and paste it to dependancy folder
2. do same set up as glfw
